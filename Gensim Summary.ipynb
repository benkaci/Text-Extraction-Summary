      "When a tumor suppressor gene mutates, cells grow uncontrollably. And they may eventually form a tumor.\n",
      "Examples of tumor suppressor genes include BRCA1, BRCA2, and p53 or TP53.\n",
      "Germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes increase a woman’s risk of developing hereditary breast or ovarian cancers and a man’s risk of developing hereditary prostate or breast cancers. They also increase the risk of pancreatic cancer and melanoma in women and men.\n",
      "The most commonly mutated gene in people with cancer is p53 or TP53. More than 50% of cancers involve a missing or damaged p53 gene. Most p53 gene mutations are acquired. Germline p53 mutations are rare, but patients who carry them are at a higher risk of developing many different types of cancer.\n",
      "Oncogenes. These turn a healthy cell into a cancerous cell. Mutations in these genes are not known to be inherited.\n",
      "Two common oncogenes are:\n",
      "HER2, a specialized protein that controls cancer growth and spread. It is found in some cancer cells. For example, breast and ovarian cancer cells.\n",
      "The RAS family of genes, which makes proteins involved in cell communication pathways, cell growth, and cell death.\n",
      "DNA repair genes. These fix mistakes made when DNA is copied. Many of them function as tumor suppressor genes. BRCA1, BRCA2, and p53 are all DNA repair genes.\n",
      "If a person has an error in a DNA repair gene, mistakes remain uncorrected. Then, the mistakes become mutations. These mutations may eventually lead to cancer, particularly mutations in tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes.\n",
      "Mutations in DNA repair genes may be inherited or acquired. Lynch syndrome is an example of the inherited kind. BRCA1, BRCA2, and p53 mutations and their associated syndromes are also inherited.\n",
      "Researchers have learned a lot about how cancer genes work. But many cancers are not linked with a specific gene. Cancer likely involves multiple gene mutations. Moreover, some evidence suggests that genes interact with their environment. This further complicates our understanding of the role genes play in cancer.\n",
      "Researchers continue to study how genetic changes affect cancer development. This knowledge has led to improvements in cancer care, including early detection, risk reduction, the use of targeted therapy, and survival.\n",
